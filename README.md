# Inference in Lean
This project formalizes the basics of first-order logic and proves soundness of the common resolution rules in propositional and first-order logic.
We achieve this by closely following Chapter 3 of the lecture notes from the course [Automated Theorem Proving](https://www.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ws-2024-25/atp_de.html).
